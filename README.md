# YubiKey-Based Autonomous Sub-Key Network

A theoretical framework for securing device-to-router communications using YubiKeys as hardware security modules, providing robust encryption, mutual authentication, and tamper resistance.

## Overview

This repository presents a comprehensive theoretical framework for implementing advanced security measures in device-to-router communications. The system leverages YubiKeys as hardware security modules to create an autonomous network of cryptographic sub-keys, managed by a central server running `gpg-agent`.

### Key Features

- **Hardware-Enforced Key Isolation**: Private keys remain secured within YubiKeys
- **Session-Based Encryption**: Unique ephemeral keys for each communication session
- **Mutual Authentication**: Cryptographic verification between devices and routers
- **Encrypted Metadata**: Protection of DNS queries and traffic patterns
- **Replay/Tampering Prevention**: Nonce-based protection against packet manipulation
- **Advanced Threat Resilience**: Hardware-based protection against side-channel attacks

## System Architecture

The system is built around four core components:

1. **Master YubiKey (Root of Trust)**
   - Stores the master private key
   - Signs and manages cryptographic sub-keys
   - Operates through a secure local server

2. **Device YubiKeys**
   - Hold unique sub-keys for each network device
   - Perform encryption operations for outbound traffic
   - Enable mutual authentication with routers

3. **Router YubiKeys**
   - Contain router-specific sub-keys
   - Decrypt and validate incoming device traffic
   - Establish secure tunnels for external communications

4. **Local Server with gpg-agent**
   - Manages key lifecycle operations
   - Monitors for security anomalies
   - Handles key distribution and revocation

## Security Measures

### Comprehensive Protection Against:

- Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks
- Packet Sniffing and Traffic Analysis
- Session Hijacking
- Rogue Access Points
- Replay Attacks
- Side-Channel Attacks
- Metadata Leakage
- Signal Exploitation
- Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)
