# 🔐 YubiKey-Based Autonomous Sub-Key Network

A theoretical framework for securing device-to-router communications using YubiKeys as hardware security modules, providing robust encryption, mutual authentication, and tamper resistance.

## 📖 Introduction

This repository presents a comprehensive theoretical framework for implementing advanced security measures in device-to-router communications. The system leverages YubiKeys as hardware security modules to create an autonomous network of cryptographic sub-keys, managed by a central server running `gpg-agent`.

### 📡 Wireless Communication Security

The system's architecture makes wireless communication interception theoretically impossible through several key mechanisms:

1. 🛡️ **Hardware-Based Key Protection**: All private keys are stored in YubiKey hardware security modules, making key extraction physically impossible without tampering detection.

2. 🔄 **Dynamic Session Keys**: Each communication session uses unique ephemeral keys derived from the hardware-protected master keys, ensuring that even if one session is compromised (which is highly unlikely), other sessions remain secure.

3. 🔒 **End-to-End Hardware Encryption**: All data is encrypted and decrypted directly within the YubiKey hardware on both device and router sides, never exposing keys or plaintext in system memory.

4. 🤝 **Zero-Knowledge Protocol**: The system employs a zero-knowledge proof mechanism where devices and routers can authenticate each other without transmitting any sensitive key material.

5. 🔮 **Quantum-Resistant Design**: The framework is designed to be compatible with post-quantum cryptographic algorithms, providing protection against future quantum computing threats.

### ⭐ Key Features

- 🔑 **Hardware-Enforced Key Isolation**: Private keys remain secured within YubiKeys
- 🔄 **Session-Based Encryption**: Unique ephemeral keys for each communication session
- 🤝 **Mutual Authentication**: Cryptographic verification between devices and routers

- 🛡️ **Replay/Tampering Prevention**: Nonce-based protection against packet manipulation
- 💪 **Advanced Threat Resilience**: Hardware-based protection against side-channel attacks
- ⏱️ **Perfect Forward Secrecy**: Compromise of current keys cannot affect past communications
- 🔮 **Quantum-Safe Options**: Support for post-quantum cryptographic algorithms
- 🏰 **Zero Trust Architecture**: Every network request is fully authenticated and encrypted
