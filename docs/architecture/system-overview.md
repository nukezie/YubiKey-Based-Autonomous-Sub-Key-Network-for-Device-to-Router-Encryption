## Communication Flow

```
[Device YubiKey] → Encrypted Traffic → [Router YubiKey]
         ↑                                    ↑
         |                                    |
         ↓                                    ↓
[Device Sub-Key] ← Key Management ← [Router Sub-Key]
         ↑                                    ↑
         |                                    |
         +----------------+------------------+
                         ↓
              [Master YubiKey + Server]
